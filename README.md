# Awesome Pizza - Work in Progress

Awesome Pizza is a backend system designed to manage pizza orders, allowing users to create and track orders, as well as providing an API for pizzeria staff to manage orders.

This project was created as an exercise and is currently a work in progress. The following information outlines how to set up and interact with the system, but please be aware that features and documentation are still being developed.

## Features

- **Order Management**: Customers can create and track their pizza orders.
- **API for Pizzeria Staff**: Staff can update the order status and view the next order in queue.
